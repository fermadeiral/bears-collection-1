= Experimental And Helpful Tools
:toc:

This is the home for experimental and helpful tools for both development and production environments.
Utilities that prove themself useful may be promoted into ovirt-engine-tools rpm or any other
relevant package that may be.

To avoid proliferation of utils and scripts please make sure first if a similar tool
already exist and just missing the functionality proposed.

Being a contrib doesn't mean the code should be dodgy or messy. Use all the best practices
out there. The best tools have the best chance to go mainline.

== Tools
=== `log-control.sh`
log-control is a script to change logging level of various
log categories (java packages) in real time.

For example to log all db queries into the log:

```bash
    log-control.sh org.ovirt.engine.core.dal DEBUG
```

= TODO
- should we create an rpm for contrib - ovirt-engine-contrib?
 or just install with the rpm under /.../lib/ovirt-engine/contrib
